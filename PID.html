<h1>Pelvic Inflammatory Disease</h1>
    <p>PID will probably be one of the commonest
        gynaecological diseases you will see, and may account for
        1/3 of your surgical admissions. It describes a syndrome
        of pelvic infection as seen in women. If it is common in
        your area, many of the women of childbearing age,
        who are not pregnant and who present with abdominal
        pain may have it. You may admit 2-3 every week,
        and treat ten times as many as outpatients. The numbers of
        these patients, their frequently long stays in hospital,
        the surgery they need, the complications that follow and
        their mortality, make PID a major public health
        problem.</p> 
    <p>Infection elsewhere in the abdominal cavity usually
        originates in the bowel, but infection in a woman's
        pelvis usually starts in the genital tract. With the rare
        exception of tuberculosis, it always ascends from the
        vagina and cervix. </p>
    <p>PID is thus only a disease of women. It is even more
        common and severe with HIV disease, although it may
        appear less impressive because of the body’s failure to
        mount a counter-attack</p>
    <p><i>Be very careful with the diagnosis of PID in pregnancy.</i>
        You may only make this diagnosis if you have
        actually seen it during laparoscopy or laparotomy.
        Otherwise it is far more likely that the diagnosis is
        something else, e.g. torsion of adnexae/fibroid/bowel,
        an ectopic gestation, an extra-uterine pregnancy,
        malaria, septic miscarriage, appendicitis, uterine
        rupture, red degeneration of a fibroid, typhoid, urinary
        tract infection or obstruction.</p>
    <p>Infection spreads from the vagina to cause: </p>
        <ol>
            <li>cervicitis.</li>
            <li>endometritis.</li>
            <li>salpingitis or pyo- or hydro-salpinx. </li>
            <li>salpingo-oophoritis or a tubo-ovarian abscess.</li>
            <li>pelvic peritonitis or pelvic abscess.</li>
            <li>generalized peritonitis or peritoneal abscesses.</li>
        </ol>
    <p>Infection may also spread through the uterine wall into the
        broad ligaments to cause metritis, pelvic cellulitis
        (parametritis), a broad ligament abscess, or septic
        thrombophlebitis of the ovarian or the uterine veins.
        This is very serious and causes septicaemia with few local
        signs. This occurs mostly after a pregnancy and is then
        called either puerperal sepsis (22.14) or post-abortal
        sepsis. This is by definition not called PID although the
        first-line treatment is the same. </p>
    <p>If antibiotics do not help in an infection related to
        pregnancy, a hysterectomy may be necessary to save a
        patient<q>’</q> life. Hysterectomy is not helpful in severe PID,
        but of course if both tubes are blocked or need removal
        because of pus, the result is just the same: infertility.</p>
    <p>Both acute and chronic PID may cause an inflammatory
        mass involving the inflamed tubes, the ovaries, the uterus,
        the omentum, and loops of bowel. Between all these there
        are collections of pus, and in chronic cases fluid-filled
        collections between peritoneal surfaces (pseudocysts).
        PID is often but not always bilateral.</p>
    <p>It is convenient to discuss separately:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Infection unrelated to pregnancy, that is PID which
                does not obviously follow miscarriage or delivery.
                Because PID typically follows a period, it is sometimes
                called 'postmenstrual PID'. It is one of the most serious
                effects of sexually transmitted disease in women. </li>
            <li>Post-abortal infection (septic miscarriage: 23.2).</li>
            <li> Infected obstructed labour (21.5).</li>
            <li> Puerperal sepsis (22.14). </li>
            <li> Sepsis after Caesarean Section (21.13)</li>
        </ol>
    <img class="pelvSep" src="./resources/images/PIDimg1.png">
    <p>A patient with 'postmenstrual PID' is not pregnant; she has
        suffered no birth trauma and there are no infected products
        of conception. She may however have an intra-uterine
        device (IUD) in the uterus, which increases the risk of
        infection, but not as seriously as was previously supposed.
        PID is seldom fatal, and never causes septic
        thrombophlebitis. The pregnancy-related infections are all
        dangerous, and can kill. Post-abortal peritonitis is
        particularly deadly and has a mortality of 50%.</p>
    <p>The organisms (gonococci, mycoplasma, chlamydia)
        responsible for PID may be sexually transmitted.
        These can pave the way for other organisms, especially
        anaerobes, and through tubal damage allow infestation by
        other organisms which may normally live in the vagina;
        viz. coliforms, various anaerobes, especially bacteroides,
        and rarely actinomyces. The latter organisms
        (and sometimes even the former) live harmlessly in the
        vagina and cervix, and only cause disease when the
        barriers to spread are removed by:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Miscarriage or delivery. </li>
            <li>Menstruation</li>
            <li>After D&C, IUD insertion, or hysterosalpingogram. </li>
            <li>HIV disease.</li>
        </ol>
    <p>Many gonococci, and typically all chlamydia and
        mycoplasma are sensitive to tetracycline. But when
        infection follows pregnancy or a miscarriage, a mixture of
        organisms is responsible, including anaerobes, for which
        the patient needs metronidazole with chloramphenicol.
        By the time many patients present, secondary infection is
        likely, whatever the primary cause of the infection.</p>
    <p>The clinical manifestations of pelvic sepsis are wide.
        They range from an otherwise symptomless infertility
        caused by blocked tubes, to generalized peritonitis,
        septicaemia and septic shock, with everything between
        these two extremes. Like a fire, PID can be of any degree
        of severity, from smouldering to fulminating. Also, like a
        fire, it can die down, only to light up again later.</p>
    <p><b>The typical acute presentation</b> is of fever, bilateral lower
        abdominal pain, and tenderness, but seldom severe
        rigidity. There is also usually urinary frequency,
        dyspareunia, irregular or prolonged periods, and also a
        vaginal discharge. The patient may not mention all these
        symptoms, especially if she is a young unmarried girl.
        The symptoms are usually mild, but can be severe with
        signs of peritonitis and occasionally septic shock.
        Acute cases are often atypical, either because the disease
        is mild, or because it has been modified by previous
        treatment or HIV disease. </p>
    <p>On pelvic examination, there is usually acute tenderness
        especially with moving the cervix side-to-side (cervical
        excitation). The pain may be so intense that you have to
        repeat the examination after you have administered an
        analgesic. There may also be a lower abdominal mass,
        vomiting, fever and a very high ESR.</p>
    <p>Then you might find a minimally tender swelling in the
        left or right iliac fossa from which you can aspirate
        greenish pus (which typically does not yield a responsible
        organism on culture).</p>
    <p><b>The typical chronic presentation</b> includes infertility,
        and pelvic pain, often with dyspareunia, heavy and
        irregular menses, dysmenorrhoea, perhaps a chronic
        vaginal discharge, poor general health, and much misery.
        The diagnosis may be difficult; the differential diagnoses
        includes endometriosis and psychosomatic pain.</p>
    <p>ULTRASOUND will show thickened adnexae, uterine
        enlargement and free fluid in the pelvis, especially the
        pouch of Douglas, and will reliably confirm the diagnosis
        (38.2J).</p>
    <p>You can usually treat PID non-operatively, but remove an
        IUD if present. Make sure she can then get an alternative
        contraceptive. Condoms provide some protection against
        sexually-transmitted infections (STI) and hence PID;
        depo-provera, implants and the contraceptive pill do not
        prevent STI but often prevent PID, which is a complication
        of STI and hence reduce infertility. </p>
    <p>Occasionally, you will need to drain pus. Unfortunately,
        once PID has become chronic, there may be recurrent pain.
        The pain threshold is likely to be low if there is also
        infertility. <i>Don't operate on chronic PID,</i> because once it
        has been present for >4wks, the pelvic organs will be so
        densely stuck to one another that freeing them will be
        difficult and dangerous: <i>you can easily injure the bowel.</i>
        If surgery is indicated, be conservative. Leave the pelvic
        organs intact unless there is a tubo-ovarian abscess.
        Removing this can be difficult, so open it and drain it.
        If you leave the uterus and some ovarian tissue intact,
        menstruation will continue. Otherwise (if the ovaries have
        to be removed) advise hormone supplements for younger
        women (in the form of the contraceptive pill) till the age of
        45yrs, but beware: <i>oestrogen therapy increases the risk of
        breast and uterine cancer.</i></p>

    <h2>A. Acute PID</h2>
    <p>DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS.</p>
    <p>Acute PID has mostly to be distinguished from other
        causes of acute lower abdominal pain (10.1), including
        appendicitis (14.1), mesenteric adenitis and a urinary
        infection. The main gynaecological differential diagnosis
        is a ruptured ectopic gestation (20.6), torsion of an ovarian
        cyst or uterine fibroid, or a corpus luteum haemorrhage.
        <i>Fixity of the pelvic organs on vaginal examination is no
        help in distinguishing</i> between PID, tuberculosis,
        and endometriosis, because all have these features</p>
    <p><b>Suggesting a ruptured ectopic gestation (20.6):</b></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Significant anaemia or circulatory shock.</li>
        <li>One or more periods missed by more than a few days,
            often followed by a small loss of dark or brownish blood
            vaginally. </li>
        <li>More tender on one side of the vagina than the other.</li>
        <li>A mass on one side or in the pouch of Douglas,
            which is not growing. </li>
        <li>No fever.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>N.B. A -ve monoclonal urine pregnancy test excludes an
        ectopic gestation.</p>
    <p>N.B. If an ectopic gestation is suspected, <i>do not perform
        a vaginal examination if there is no immediate access to a
        theatre.</i> Numerous are the tales of patients collapsing in
        shock because a vaginal examination re-ruptured the
        ectopic.</p>
    <p>An elegant diagnostic tool is peritoneal lavage: run 200ml
        of warm saline, via a drip system, into the lower abdomen.
        Then ask the patient roll herself a few times from left to
        right. Then put the fluid bag on the floor. Observe fluid
        running back into the bag: you may need to manipulate the
        cannula a little to achieve a nice flow. If the fluid is clear,
        there is most probably no acutely bleeding ruptured
        ectopic gestation.</p>
    <p><b>Suggesting a twisted ovarian cyst or uterine fibroid:</b>
        very acute colicky lower abdominal pain, sometimes with
        vomiting; a mass with no fever initially. </p>
    <p>CAUTION!</p>
        <ol>
            <li>The amount of vaginal discharge is not proportional to
                the severity of PID. Candida and Trichomonas cause a
                profuse discharge, but do not cause PID. Gonococci and
                Chlamydia cause a less obvious mucopurulent discharge.</li>
            <li>Expect the diagnosis of PID to be wrong in about 20%
                of patients but examine the partner if possible: if he has a
                urethral discharge, PID is virtually certain.</li>
        </ol>
    <p>GRACE (17yrs) was admitted with vaginal bleeding and fever,
        having attempted to induce an abortion on herself at 16wks.
        The cervix was wide open, the products of conception were visible, and
        there was a foul discharge. She was treated with antibiotics for 24hrs and
        then the uterus was evacuated. A few days later she was very ill with a
        distended abdomen. 3l of thin pus were washed out of the abdominal
        cavity and tetracycline was instilled abdominally. There was no
        perforation of the uterus. She was treated with more antibiotics, and
        intravenous fluids, and high calorie liquid fluid was given orally in the
        hope to prevent severe acute malnutrition affecting her immune system.
        After 2wks, she was still febrile and very ill. A 2nd laparatomy was done
        to drain residual abscesses. Chronic sores developed at the sites of the
        drainage tubes, which continued to discharge pus. She did not eat well,
        and vomited from episodes of subacute obstruction, but was not well
        enough for a 3rd laparotomy. Three months after admission she died
        extremely wasted. She did not have HIV disease.</p>
    <p>LESSONS (1) This is a typical history; any septic abortion, particularly
        an unskilfully induced one, is dangerous. (2) Re-laparotomy should have
        been done earlier at 48hrs and the abdomen left open. Although it is
        dramatic, this should probably be combined with a hysterectomy to save
        her life if the first operation does not result in an obvious improvement.
        An off-pink flaccid non-elastic feeling uterus will in this situation
        probably maintain its sepsis. Hysterectomy is also needed in case of
        post-abortal tetanus. (3) Septic retained products of conception are not
        reached by antibiotics and are an ideal meal for micro-organisms. IV
        antibiotics followed as soon as possible by an evacuation is the correct
        treatment: no 24hr delay is justified. </p>
    <p>MANAGEMENT. </p>
    <p>You can usually treat PID as an outpatient if there is no
        peritoneal irritation and no pelvic mass (stage I).
        Otherwise arrange admission if: </p>
    <ol>
        <li>There is: lower quadrant peritoneal irritation and/or an
            IUD in situ, (stage II).</li>
        <li>There is an adnexal mass (stage III).</li>
        <li>There is septic shock (stage IV).</li>
        <li>You cannot exclude an acute surgical condition,
            especially an ectopic gestation. </li>
        <li>Outpatient treatment has failed</li>
        <li>There is poor patient compliance.</li>
    </ol> 
    <p>ANTIBIOTICS. </p>
    <p>N.B. Cervical smears and cultures are of little help in
        choosing an antibiotic, because the organisms in the cervix
        may not be those which are causing the infection
        elsewhere. <i>The absence of gonococci in a cervical smear
        does not exclude gonococcal infection.</i> Usually, you will
        need to treat blindly with a broad-spectrum antibiotic.
        If possible, follow up and treat any sexual partners.</p>
    <p>N.B. The regional university, preferably with an
        adequate laboratory, should perform culture and sensitivity
        testing of pus obtained from the abdominal cavity of a
        number of PID<q>’</q>s every few years and inform you about the
        best antibiotics to use (initially, blindly) in your region.</p>
    <p><b>For Stage I,</b> use tetracycline 500mg qid and
        metronidazole 400mg tid, for 7-10days (2.8). Doxycycline
        100mg bd is better than tetracycline but is more expensive.
        Insist on completion of the course. Also, use an analgesic,
        advise abstinence from sexual intercourse until symptoms
        have resolved, and until all sexual partners have been
        treated. </p>
    <p><b>If there is no response</b> (no better, rising temperature,
        more pain), check: </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Is the diagnosis correct?</li>
        <li>Is there a mass or collection of pus somewhere which
            needs draining? </li>
        <li>Are you using the right antibiotic at the right dose with
            the right frequency for at least 3days?</li>
        <li>Is there an IUD which has not been removed?
            Otherwise, proceed to Stage II.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><b>For Stage II,</b> use broad-spectrum IV antibiotics:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>benzylpenicillin 1·2g qid</li>
        <li>chloramphenicol 1g stat followed by 500mg qid, and/or
            depending on severity</li>
        <li>gentamicin 240mg od, plus</li>
        <li>metronidazole 500mg tid rectally.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><b>If there is no response or a mass develops,</b> (STAGE III),
        check whether the mass is in the pouch of Douglas, or if it
        is extending from the pelvis into the abdomen.</p>
    <p>N.B. Many patients with acute PID develop a mass of
        matted viscera (distinct from an abscess which needs
        drainage). Check with an ultrasound (38.2K). This may
        take 6wks to resolve, but <i>there is no point in continuing
        antibiotics for more than 2wks.</i> If the illness persists
        (raised ESR with a spiking temperature after 2wks), there
        probably is an abscess which needs draining vaginally
        (colpotomy, 10.3) or suprapubically. </p>
