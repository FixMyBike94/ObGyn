    <h1>Abnormal and dysfunctional
        uterine bleeding (DUB)</h1>
    <p>Abnormal uterine bleeding includes any bleeding which is
        abnormal in its degree and timing. Dysfunctional uterine
        bleeding (DUB) is irregular, heavy or long-lasting
        bleeding <i>not</i> related to infection, pregnancy, medication or
        neoplasm.</p>
    <p>In low-resource countries, abnormal uterine bleeding
        usually has some obvious pathology. The list of its
        possible causes is a long one and is given below.
        Only diagnose DUB after you have excluded obvious
        pathology. DUB occurs most commonly at the extremes of
        reproductive life, in young girls not long after menarche,
        and in older women nearing the menopause,
        before complete amenorrhoea sets in. DUB should be an
        uncommon diagnosis in the prime of life; if you make it
        often, you are probably misdiagnosing miscarriages,
        <i>Chlamydia</i> and <i>Trichomonas</i> infections, cervical cancer,
        submucosal fibroids, or chronic ectopic gestation. </p>
    <p>The commonest cause of DUB is the failure to ovulate.
        Because ovulation does not occur in the middle of a cycle
        as it should, the corpus luteum does not develop and
        produce progesterone normally. The endometrium grows
        abnormally thick under the influence of unopposed
        oestrogen, and eventually begins to shed unevenly.
        Courses of progestagen stop bleeding temporarily,
        and when these are stopped normal periods usually follow.</p>
    <p>The important diseases not to miss are carcinoma of the
        cervix (very common), and, usually in women >35yrs,
        mostly post-menopausal, carcinoma of the endometrium.
        The investigation of abnormal bleeding often requires
        intervention, but you may have to limit yourself to priority
        cases. These are inter-menstrual bleeding, and especially
        post-coital bleeding, which does not have some more
        obvious cause. Heavy regular periods are a common
        complaint, and are usually benign but may result in severe
        anaemia.</p>
    <p>HISTORY. A careful history and examination will nearly
        always reveal some obvious cause. </p>
    <p>ONSET “When did the bleeding start?” “For how many
        days do you bleed and when?” “Are you bleeding now?”
        “Were you bleeding last week? Last month?” </p>
    <p>Ask the woman to describe the bleeding pattern by giving
        approximate dates and amounts. Make sure the patient
        distinguishes blood escaping vaginally, from blood in the
        urine. If she sometimes does not bleed at all for a week or
        so, a malignancy is unlikely.</p>
    <p>CAUTION! </p>
    <ol>
        <li><i>Avoid labels like 'polymenorrhoea', 'menorrhagia'
            <q>metrorrhagia</q> etc.</i> because they are too vague.</li>
        <li>Ask about post-coital bleeding. </li>
    </ol>
    <p>EXAMINATION. Is there anaemia? Examine the pelvic
        abdomen bimanually. Examine the cervix with a
        speculum. </p>
